# Moving Pictures of the Human Microbiome (Qiita-550)

Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical 
to developing treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as 
obesity, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and malnutrition. 
Sequencing and computational technologies, however, have been a limiting factor 
in performing dense time series analysis of the human microbiome. Here, we 
present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two 
individuals at four body sites over 396 time points.

## Format

An object of class `TreeSummarizedExperiment`. The dataset was originally in 
the `phyloseq`(MovingPictures.rda) format and has been converted to a `
TreeSummarizedExperiment`(MovingPictures.rds) 
using [mia](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/) tools.
